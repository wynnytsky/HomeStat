		<p>The <b>HOME-STAT daily dashboard</b> presents data from 311 service requests made by the public and the HOME-STAT canvassing team, as well as supplemental data from select organizations. The data is based on observations of people perceived to be street homeless.</p>

		<p>The <b>HOME-STAT monthly dashboard</b> presents data from the City’s contracted Street Outreach Teams on HOME-STAT clients and select progress milestones and from 311. Additional reporting categories will be introduced as data becomes available.</p>

				<h1>311 Service Request Data</h1>
			</article>
			<article>
				<h1>311 requests</h1>
				<p>311 Service Requests made by both the public and the HOME-STAT canvassing team. The number of 311 requests can vary from day to day based on multiple factors. Weather, time of day, holidays, and major events can affect the number of street homeless people who are visible as well as the number of people who may be making 311 requests. There may be overlap between requests made by HOME-STAT canvassers and the public. The accuracy of geocoded locations depends on the quality of information provided by 311 customers.</p>
				<p>Data provided by 311, reported daily and monthly.</p>
			</article>
			<article>
				<h1>Public 311 Requests for Outreach Assistance</h1>
				<p>The total number of 311 service requests made by the public (calls and mobile app). Multiple requests could be made about one person and a single request could cover more than one person.</p>
				<p>Data provided by 311, reported daily and monthly.</p>
			</article>
			<article>
				<h1>Requests from HOME-STAT Canvassers</h1>
				<p>The total number of 311 service requests made by HOME-STAT canvassers. HOME-STAT canvassers work between 7am and 4pm seven days a week, surveying outdoor areas including streets, sidewalks, and public spaces from Canal Street to 145th Street in Manhattan and select hot spots in the other boroughs. HOME-STAT canvassers take into account the appearance, behavior, and conditions of individuals to assess whether a person may possibly be street homeless. HOME-STAT canvassers rely on visual observations, do not engage with individuals, and do not provide outreach services.</p>
				<p>Data provided by 311, reported daily and monthly.</p>
			</article>
			<article>
				<h1>Public 311 Requests routed to NYPD</h1>
				<p>The total number of 311 service requests made by the public (calls and mobile app) related to homeless persons repeatedly occupying the same location or setting up temporary dwellings. Multiple requests could be made about one person and a single request could cover more than one person. HOME-STAT canvassers do not route requests to NYPD.</p>
				<p>Data provided by 311, reported daily and monthly.</p>
			</article>
			<article>
				<h1>Extreme Cold Weather</h1>
				<p>The Department of Homeless Services activates Code Blue when the National Weather Service issues a Cold Weather Alert. During Code Blue hours (4 pm to 8 am), 311 requests for homeless outreach assistance are routed directly to 911. HOME-STAT canvassers may also be re-assigned to other projects at the discretion of the Department of Homeless Services. These changes will affect the volume of 311 service requests from both the public and the HOME-STAT canvassing team.</p>
